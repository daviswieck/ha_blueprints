[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdaviswieck%2Fha_blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fnhlscore-lights.yaml)
This blueprint will flash one or more lights using the team (or opponent) colors provided by the api on any score change (td, field goal, extra point), optionally excluding opponent scores.

You can track as many games and control as many lights as youâ€™d like, just select them in the automation.  You can also select the number of times to cycle through the team colors (1-15 times).
